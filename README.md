# SNAP Eval

This repo contains information on Propel's work building a SNAP Eval (evaluation) for benchmarking and assessing large language models' (LLM) capabilities related to the SNAP or food stamp program.

## Illustrative 25 test cases

You can find our release of 25 illustrative SNAP eval cases in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-0zlX-80w7edpOlZWUPvTkp28J4HS_ZyKnuDjDtKeoc/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

### Running the 25 eval case test set using Promptfoo

You can run the eval test cases in that spreadsheet above using the Promptfoo tool by using the promptfooconfig.yaml file in the included folder.

Note you will need to include API keys for the 3 providers in that config file (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.)
